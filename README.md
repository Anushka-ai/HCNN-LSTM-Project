# HCNN-LSTM-Project
## Problem Statement
Not properly address the missing data in EHR environment.
Primary detection of EHR improper data has a difficult problem and if it is not detected in initial phase the prediction process flow can be collapsed. 
Failed to focus on the In-depth investigations for the retrieved improper data in EHR dataset. 
Requires more time for classification of data.


## Objective
The purpose of the proposed work is to 
To process the structured / unstructured data in EHR data to assess the prediction growth in EHR Environment. 
To use latent factor model to restructure the misplaced data from the EHR data collected from an EHR Environment. 
To determine the major improper data in the region. 
To handle structured data consult with healthcare experts to extract useful features automatically using HCNN-LSTM algorithm. 
To propose a novel HCNN-LSTM based multimodal risk prediction (Health Care Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory) algorithm for structured / unstructured data. 
The EHR risk model is obtained by the process of structured / unstructured features. 
Through the experiment, we draw a conclusion that the performance of HCNN-LSTM is better than state-of-art methods.
